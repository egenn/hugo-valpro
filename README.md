# Hugo Valpro

A simple [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme forked from https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium.


# Usage

Install blogdown, if you don't have it already:
```r
remotes::install_github('rstudio/blogdown')  
```
Create a new blogdown RStudio project and type in "egenn/hugo-valpro" for theme.  

Or, within some (new) project:

```r
blogdown::new_site(theme = 'egenn/hugo-valpro')
```
